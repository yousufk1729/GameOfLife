# Conway's Game of Life

An understandable implementation of Conway's Game of Life.

```c
g,a,m,e,o,f,li[16][16],fe[16][16]={{0,1
},{0,0,1},{1,1,1}};main()??<for(;;){for
(a=g=0;a<16;g=++g>15?(printf("\xA"),a++
,0):g)??<printf(fe[a][g]?"\x23":"\x2E")
;for(m=0,o=e=-1;o<2;e=++e>1?(o++,-1):e)
(o||e)&&fe[((a+e)%16+16)%16][((g+o)%16+
16)%16]&&m++; a[li][g]=a[fe??)[g??)?m>>
1&1:!(m-0b11);}for(f=0x100;f--;){*(*fe+
f)=*(*li+f);for(volatile j=0x4FFFF;j--;
);};printf("\x1b[16A\x1b[16D");}({;});}
```

Hello everyone! Or should I say, "Hello World" am I right guys?????? I am a new C programmer and I am trying to improve my C programming skills by implementing Conway’s Game of Life with the iconic glider moving around the screen. I am still new to the language though. In Python, I never have to declare something called “types” and something called int main()? Why is main an int? I don’t really get it.  Returning 0 is just useless (especially after C99) and I am told that a smaller program is faster for the computer to run, so I just removed that. Also, I got told to “include” std files, which sounds dangerous. In Python I can just print things with print, but I think they made a typo and added an f. Thankfully, I am very familiar with for loops so I used them a lot.

Sometimes I only have access to an ISO-646-compliant keyboard, which made it hard to type some characters, so I had to improvise. And, in my embedded programming class, the professor said something about volatile variables, and that sounded cool so I made sure to add it here as well. I also know computers speak in binary numbers and extra large numbers (indicated with the x for their humongous size) so I added lots of them.

Unfortunately, the pesky compiler kept telling me I had errors. I asked ChatGCC what to do to make it stop talking about my errors because it made me sad, so it gave me some flags to compile and run the code with for my x86-64 gcc 15.2 compiler:

```gcc
gcc -std=gnu17 -Wno-implicit-function-declaration -Wno-implicit-int -Wno-int-conversion -Wno-builtin-declaration-mismatch -trigraphs main.c -o main`
```

At last! My beautiful glider, complete with grid wrapping, takes off beautifully in flight. Run it yourself to see as well! I am well on my way to becoming a C expert! Let me know if it works on your machine as well!!!
